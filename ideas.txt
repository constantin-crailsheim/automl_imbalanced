1) Data-level methods
- see Advanced ML (goes beyond lecture)
- Undersampling: Tomek links, Condensed nearest neighbours
- Oversampling: SMOTE

2) Algorithmic methods
- Balanced loss

3) Hybrid methods
- Possibly combine both methods

4) Optimization
- Use Bayesian optimization
- Use DEHB


Ideas:
- Check imputation.
- use ensemble of restarts
- Add imbalanced data methods.
- Read about DEHB.

ToDo:
- Save CV correctly
- Write docstrings.
- Check whether cross validation works out.
- Improve code quality to be more robust.
